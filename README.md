Building on LoopBack's success as an open-source Node.js framework, IBM API Connect provides the newest tools to use with LoopBack projects. It includes a graphical tool with many of the API composition features of StrongLoop Arc, plus assembly and testing of API Gateway policies using the local Micro Gateway. Some features are still available only in Arc but these will be added to API Connect in the next few months.

API Connect also provides its own command-line tool, integrated with API management and gateway features. A free version of API Connect especially for developers is available called API Connect Essentials.
